“Oh, I’ll get to it soon” isn’t a valid study strategy. Rather, you have to be intentional about planning set study sessions.<br>
On your calendar, mark out chunks of time that you can devote to your studies. You should aim to schedule some study time each day, but other commitments may necessitate that some sessions are longer than others.
Harder classes require more study time. So, too, do classes that are worth several credits..<br> For each credit hour that you’re taking, consider devoting one to three hours to studying each wee
Do you digest content quickly, or do you need time to let the material sink in? .<br>Only you know what pace is best for you.
There’s no right (or wrong) study pace. So, don’t try matching someone else’s speed .<br>.Instead, through trial and error, find what works for you. Just remember that slower studying will require that you devote more time to your school
Exhaustion helps no one perform their best. Your body needs rest; getting enough sleep is crucial for memory function..<br>This is one reason that scheduling study time is so important: It reduces the temptation to stay up all night cramming for a big test. Instead, you should aim for seven or more hours of sleep the night before an exam.

<p>There’s a delicate balance when it comes to the best study spot: You need a place that’s comfortable without being so relaxing that you end up falling asleepThere’s a delicate balance when it comes to the best study spot: You need a place that’s comfo 
 quiet cafe or your local library.. For some people, that means working at a desk<br>. Others do better on the couch or at the kitchen table. Your bed, on the other hand, may be too comfy.
Surrounding yourself with peace and quiet helps you focus. If your kids are being loud or there’s construction going on outside your window, you might need to relocate to an upstairs bedroom, a quiet cafe or your local library.
